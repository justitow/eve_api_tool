REACTIONS
activityID=11

SELECT * FROM INVTYPES WHERE INVTYPES.TYPEID IN (SELECT typeid FROM industryactivity where activityid=11); This gets the invtypes info for all reactions (not counting 'unrefined')

Maybe. Now I need to check the groups found with:  

SELECT * FROM invGroups WHERE UPPER(groupName) like '%REACTION%';

groupID|categoryID|groupName|iconID|useBasePrice
436|24|Simple Reaction|2665|1|0|0|0|1
484|24|Complex Reactions|2666|1|0|0|0|1
661|24|Simple Biochemical Reactions|2665|0|0|0|0|1
662|24|Complex Biochemical Reactions|2665|0|0|0|0|1
977|24|Hybrid Reactions||1|0|0|0|1

1888|9|Composite Reaction Formulas||1|0|0|0|1
1889|9|Polymer Reaction Formulas||1|0|0|0|1
1890|9|Biochemical Reaction Formulas||1|0|0|0|1

The category from the first part is 24, which means REACTION (is this now deprecated?)
The category from the second aprt is 9, which means BLUEPRINT

Assuming I'm not making boosters, I just need to look at 1888 and 1889
industryActivity is just the time for the reaction

Now I want to know about PI materials....I'll check group
PI Categories?

SELECT * FROM invCategories WHERE UPPER(categoryName) LIKE '%PLANET%';
categoryID|categoryName|iconID|published
41|Planetary Interaction||1
42|Planetary Resources||1
43|Planetary Commodities||1


industryActivity is the time it takes for blueprints to happen, and links the typeid of the reaction blueprint to the activity id

industryBlueprint is MaxProductionLimit - this is....?

SELECT typeID FROM invTypes WHERE groupID IN (1888, 1889, 1890);
SELECT typeID FROM industryActivity WHERE activityID=11;  **** I like this one better because industryActivity is way smaller


SELECT * FROM industryActivityProducts WHERE typeID IN (SELECT typeID FROM industryActivity WHERE activityID=11);

typeID|activityID|productTypeID|quantity

What is this block about?
Making the urefined reaction thingy
Can either leave this out or include it
Might just allow it to exist.


SELECT * FROM industryActivityMaterials WHERE typeID IN (SELECT typeID FROM industryActivity WHERE activityID=11);

Everything seems to be within order


SELECT DISTINCT materialTypeID FROM industryActivityMaterials WHERE typeID IN(SELECT typeID FROM industryActivity WHERE activityID=11) ORDER BY materialTypeID ASC;
SELECT DISTINCT productTypeID FROM industryActivityProducts WHERE typeID IN(SELECT typeID FROM industryActivity WHERE activityID=11) ORDER BY materialTypeID ASC;


SELECT typeID FROM industryActivityMaterials WHERE typeID IN(SELECT typeID FROM industryActivity WHERE activityID=11) AND materialTypeID in (SELECT DISTINCT productTypeID FROM industryActivityProducts WHERE typeID IN(SELECT typeID FROM industryActivity WHERE activityID=11))ORDER BY materialTypeID ASC;
I also need to take into account that it is possible to use the subreactions instead of
